# toDoApp

Basic To do app for learning

1. add task and get it on browser + mongo db database
2. delete functionality is also there by clicking on window-close icon button near the task , it will be deleted from the browser screen and databse also.
3. node_modules/ folder has been deleted and it can be created by npm init command as first and always its a good practice to use .gitignore and hide your node_modules/ folder from being public.

Rest you can use it as per your requirement , take reference , design it as per your project needs.
